https://github.com/DCRG-Bristol/Sprint0626

Getting Started
----------------

But for a quick intro: Downlaod the latest Binary from the github repository (pim.mltbx) https://github.com/DCRG-Bristol/pim/releases.
run this binary with Matlab open. then type the following in the command window

:code:`pim install -i pim_requirements.txt`

which will downlaod all of the required packages from github.
